Facebook Archiver
===================

Have you ever liked a post, and then tried to find it later and
had a lot of work to do that?

Facebook Archiver is the solution for you!

By installing the Chrome/Greasemonkey extesion, a "Archive" button
will be added each post on your facebook pages.

When you click an "Archive" button, a reference to that post will
be archived and you'll be easily able to retrieve and manage that later by
accessing our home page <a href="http://fbarchiver.herokuapp.com">here</a>.

Feedback is always welcome!

You can play around with the source in whatever way you want, and help
us make it better.
